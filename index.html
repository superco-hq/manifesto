    <h1>The first 0-person $1B company.</h1>
    <p><a href="https://tally.so/r/5B1XDN">&gt; We are seeking human domain experts for our agents to perform user interviews.</a></p>
    <p>We believe the future company is 95% autonomous.</p>
    <p>The core deep problem-thinking, decisions based on taste, and human-specific tasks are handled by a human. But the rest are all agents. Coding, talking to customers, marketing, customer support - everything is agents. Departments like recruiting, HR are unnecessary in this agentic company.</p>
    <p>They start with a base direction given by a human, then they talk to customers, discover unique insights, implement, sell, and grow. At the start, we will be building up this agent harness system and closely monitoring, prompting, instructing the agents. But as time goes on, we will shift more and more autonomy onto it. While the 5% of company-defining decisions are still bubbled up to humans, 95% of the company is agents.</p>
    <p>Then we will scale this out to 100s of agentic startups running on our platform.</p>
    <p>Most will fail, but we dramatically increase exposure to success. We will not sell the platform to others - this would dilute the world. But we will hire our employees to be CEOs managing a few startups each. Every role in our meta-company is a CEO. We track performance of each startup. We provide oversight. We decide which startups to kill and which get more funding. The funding comes from collective revenue from all startups.</p>
    <p>Giving full autonomy to AI gives fright to existing enterprises. But this works because our meta-enterprise quite literally depends on this very same autonomy. We do not need to worry about sales or marketing of the parent company. We do not need to worry about scalability or robustness or presentability of our agent harness, because we are, and will always be, its only customer. Instead, we observe and overarchingly guide these startups - or, 'experiments on the world' - executed by agents.</p>
    <p>We may not be as far as we think from that future.</p>
